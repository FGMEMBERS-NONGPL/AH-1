	<line>Engine Start</line>
    <line>1. The s key toggles the starboard and port turbine APU generators</line>		
    <line>2. The s key also initiated their respective turbine starters</line>
    <line>   keep pressed for 3 seconds until starter full engaged</line>
    <line>3. The Scorpion is equiped with twin 1,970 shp, 1469 kW, Magnussen KE-76 turgine generators on a</line>
	<line>	 common distribution bus feeding an ultracapacitor backup system which can at 100%</line>
    <line>   sustain rotor rpm for two minutes, in the event of a full engine failure</line>
	<line></line>	
	<line>Rotor Start</line>
    <line>1. The r key toggles the starboard and port rotors on and off</line>
    <line>3. The Scorpion is equiped with two dual co-axial ducted rotors driven by 2MW counter-rotating annular ceramic motors.</line>
    <line>   Fixed at the standard dyhedral of eight degree upward angle with a constant speed of 1770rpm delivering</line>

	<line>Normal Flight Mode</line>
    <line>1. Adjust rotor pitch using the throttle collective</line>
    <line>2. Adjust Pitch and Roll using yoke cyclic</line>
    <line>3. Adjust Yaw using rudder peddles</line>
